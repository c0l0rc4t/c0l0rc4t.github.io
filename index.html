<h1>WRITEUP 1 </h1>
 <p>Intro:	
Enumeration
 
We have 2 serivce : ssh and http
Start with gobuster and find hidden file on http service 
Gobuster dir -w wordlist -u $IP 
And we retrieve some usefull resource:
/secret 
/uploads
Inside the secret folder , we have a secretKey, maybe use for ssh (RSA)
Inside the upload folder, we have something
-	Dict.lst look like a dictionary
-	Manifesto : don’t seem to be interesting
Let take them by copy – paste or wget link
Maybe we can login to SSH (need change permission for secretkey )
Chmod 600 secretKey
Ssh -i secretKey john@$IP(you can find user john by view source code and look the comment)
Unfortunately, You need a passphare. That ok, you can use john to crack secretKey by disc.lst
 
Let try ssh with passphrae “letmein”:
 

Great, hello there
You get the flag 
Now , let’s get the root.
Privilege Escalation
 
 We can see the lxd group, can use this to escalate privileges.
I search GG and follow it
On my kali;
 
And start an HTTP server
Python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
 You can ls file on directory lxd-alpine-builder and have a file tar.gz

On victim,
 
 Go on 
 

So good, we have root flags.
